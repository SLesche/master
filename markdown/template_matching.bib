We examined susceptibility of ERP quantification measures to incremental increases in background noise through published ERP data and simulations. Measures included mean amplitude, adaptive mean, peak amplitude, peak latency, and centroid latency. Results indicated mean amplitude was the most robust against increases in background noise. The adaptive mean measure was more biased, but represented an efficient estimator of the true ERP signal particularly for individual-subject latency variability. Strong evidence is provided against using peak amplitude. For latency measures, the peak latency measure was less biased and less efficient than the centroid latency measurement. Results emphasize the prudence in reporting the number of trials retained for averaging as well as noise estimates for groups and conditions when comparing ERPs.},

Ulrich, 1998) yields more accurate estimates of differences between experimental conditions in ERP latency than other methods. However, the scores resulting from this procedure require special adjustments for further analyses and do not directly reflect each participant's latency. Here, a simple transform is proposed that retrieves estimates of each participant's latency from the subaverage scores, rendering further adjustments superfluous. Other advantages of working with participants' latencies are discussed. Results of simulations support the validity of jackknifing and the retrieval transform.},

We applied a novel task paradigm consisting of flanker stimuli presented within an n-back task and studied the interaction between inhibitory demands and load on WM updating using behavioral measures, EEG, and pupil dilation. In contrast to studies that examine the interaction between inhibitory demands and load on WM storage components, the current task paradigm allowed testing the interaction between the executive WM components updating and inhibition. We found a reduced flanker interference effect for the highest (2-back) updating load condition compared to lower updating load conditions on most measures. We interpret these findings as indicating that inhibitory control and WM updating are closely intertwined executive functions. Increased load on updating seemed to result in an overall more activated attentional network thus enhancing inhibitory control, such that task performance is less susceptible to distracting information.},
