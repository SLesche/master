# Results
All data wrangling and statistical analyses were conducted in R [Version, Citation]. We used the packages [packages]. Each of the 60 participants contributed 6 ERPs per task to the data. One ERP averaged over all trials of each of the two conditions and two more ERPs generated from an odd-even split on a trial level of that condition. These 360 ERPs each from the 3 different tasks were passed through 3 different low-pass filters and subjected to analyses with 3 separate measurement windows. We applied both the correlation-based (CORR) and distance-based (MINSQ) algorithm and either reviewed the results manually, discarded bad matches automatically or accepted the results regardless of fit. We also applied both a peak latency and area latency algorithm with either uninformed measurement windows or measurement windows transformed by the transformation parameters recovered from the CORR or MINSQ algorithm. This results in $3 \ tasks \times 3 \ filters \times 3 \ windows \times 12 \ algorithms = 324$ different extraction pipelines 

## Review process
We reviewed results of 54 out of these 324 pipelines. In total, we inspected [PERCENT] of ERPs, rejected [PERCENT] of ERPs and accepted [PERCENT] of the results despite their fit. We manually corrected the decisions in [PERCENT] of cases. When reporting the psychometric properties of the algorithms, we will focus on those values passed through manual inspection with those passed through the automatic rejection filter reported in parenthesis.

## Reliability
An overview of Spearman-Brown corrected split-half correlations $r_{tt}$ split by task, measurement window and filter setting can be found in [TABLE]. Across tasks, measurement windows and filter settings the CORR algorithm **that we manually reviewed** had mean split-half correlations of $\bar{r_{tt}} = [ANSWER]$ ($\bar{r_{tt}} = [ANSWER_AUTO]$), the MINSQ algorithm $\bar{r_{tt}} = [ANSWER]$ ($\bar{r_{tt}} = [ANSWER_AUTO]$). Uninformed area latency measures presented even better mean split-correlations $\bar{r_{tt}} = [ANSWER]$. 

## Homogeneity
An overview of a method's mean correlation with other methods $r_h$ split by task, measurement window and filter setting can be found in [TABLE]. Across tasks, measurement windows and filter settings the CORR algorithm **that we manually reviewed** had a mean homogeneity of $\bar{r_{h}} = [ANSWER]$ ($\bar{r_{h}} = [ANSWER_AUTO]$), the MINSQ algorithm $\bar{r_{h}} = [ANSWER]$ ($\bar{r_{h}} = [ANSWER_AUTO]$). Uninformed area latency measures presented slightly worse mean split-correlations $\bar{r_{h}} = [ANSWER]$. 

## Effect size
An overview of the effect size of the age effect detect by a particular method split by task, measurement window and filter setting can be found in [TABLE]. Across tasks, measurement windows and filter settings the CORR algorithm **that we manually reviewed** had a mean effect size of $\bar{\omega^2} = [ANSWER]$ ($\bar{\omega^2} = [ANSWER_AUTO]$), the MINSQ algorithm $\bar{\omega^2} = [ANSWER]$ ($\bar{\omega^2} = [ANSWER_AUTO]$). Uninformed area latency measures presented similar average effect sizes $\bar{\omega^2} = [ANSWER]$. 

## Correlation with manual rater
An overview of the correlation with latency values extracted by an expert ERP researcher [Sadus 2023] split by task, measurement window and filter setting can be found in [TABLE]. Across tasks, measurement windows and filter settings the CORR algorithm **that we manually reviewed** had mean correlations of $\bar{r} = [ANSWER]$ ($\bar{r} = [ANSWER_AUTO]$), the MINSQ algorithm $\bar{r} = [ANSWER]$ ($\bar{r} = [ANSWER_AUTO]$). Uninformed area latency measures had a mean correlation of $\bar{r} = [ANSWER]$. 

## Influence of researcher degrees of freedom
The repeated measures ANOVA with split-half correlation of a particular method as a dependent variable and the within factors filter (8 Hz vs. 16 Hz vs. 32 Hz) and measurement window (narrow vs. medium vs. wide) showed an effect of filter with [EFFECT] for the CORR algorithm, [EFFECT] for the MINSQ algorithm and [EFFECT] for uninformed area latency measures. The measurement windows had an effect of [EFFECT] for the CORR algorithm, [EFFECT] for the MINSQ algorithm and [EFFECT] for uninformed area latency measures [See TABLE].

When the correlation with manually extracted latencies was used as a dependent variable, the effect of filter settings for the CORR algorithm were [EFFECT], for the MINSQ algorithm [EFFECT] and [EFFECT] for uninformed area latency measures. The measurement windows had an effect of [EFFECT] for the CORR algorithm, [EFFECT] for the MINSQ algorithm and [EFFECT] for uninformed area latency measures [See TABLE].
