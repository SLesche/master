# Results
All data wrangling and statistical analyses were conducted in R [Version, Citation]. We used the packages [packages]. 

## Review process
We reviewed results of the CORR and MINSQ algorithms if their fit was below $r_{st} \le .60$. **make by MINSQ, CORR** Out of [NUMBER] ERPs evaluated by the algorithms, we inspected [PERCENT of CORR] of ERPs, rejected [PERCENT] of ERPs and accepted [PERCENT] of the results despite their fit. We manually corrected the decisions in [PERCENT] of cases. When reporting the psychometric properties of the algorithms, we will focus on those values passed through manual inspection with those passed through the automatic rejection filter reported in parenthesis.

## Reliability
An overview of Spearman-Brown corrected split-half correlations $r_{tt}$ split by task, measurement window and filter setting can be found in [TABLE]. Across tasks, measurement windows and filter settings the CORR algorithm **that we manually reviewed** had mean split-half correlations of $\bar{r_{tt}} = [ANSWER]$ ($\bar{r_{tt}} = [ANSWER_AUTO]$), the MINSQ algorithm $\bar{r_{tt}} = [ANSWER]$ ($\bar{r_{tt}} = [ANSWER_AUTO]$). Uninformed area latency measures presented even better mean split-correlations $\bar{r_{tt}} = [ANSWER]$. 

## Homogeneity
An overview of a method's mean correlation with other methods $r_h$ split by task, measurement window and filter setting can be found in [TABLE]. Across tasks, measurement windows and filter settings the CORR algorithm **that we manually reviewed** had a mean homogeneity of $\bar{r_{h}} = [ANSWER]$ ($\bar{r_{h}} = [ANSWER_AUTO]$), the MINSQ algorithm $\bar{r_{h}} = [ANSWER]$ ($\bar{r_{h}} = [ANSWER_AUTO]$). Uninformed area latency measures presented slightly worse mean split-correlations $\bar{r_{h}} = [ANSWER]$. 

## Effect size
An overview of the effect size of the age effect detect by a particular method split by task, measurement window and filter setting can be found in [TABLE]. Across tasks, measurement windows and filter settings the CORR algorithm **that we manually reviewed** had a mean effect size of $\bar{\omega^2} = [ANSWER]$ ($\bar{\omega^2} = [ANSWER_AUTO]$), the MINSQ algorithm $\bar{\omega^2} = [ANSWER]$ ($\bar{\omega^2} = [ANSWER_AUTO]$). Uninformed area latency measures presented similar average effect sizes $\bar{\omega^2} = [ANSWER]$. 

## Correlation with manual rater
An overview of the correlation with latency values extracted by an expert ERP researcher [Sadus 2023] split by task, measurement window and filter setting can be found in [TABLE]. Across tasks, measurement windows and filter settings the CORR algorithm **that we manually reviewed** had mean correlations of $\bar{r} = [ANSWER]$ ($\bar{r} = [ANSWER_AUTO]$), the MINSQ algorithm $\bar{r} = [ANSWER]$ ($\bar{r} = [ANSWER_AUTO]$). Uninformed area latency measures had a mean correlation of $\bar{r} = [ANSWER]$. 

## Influence of researcher degrees of freedom
The repeated measures ANOVA with split-half correlation of a particular method as a dependent variable and the within factors filter (8 Hz vs. 16 Hz vs. 32 Hz) and measurement window (narrow vs. medium vs. wide) showed an effect of filter with [EFFECT] for the CORR algorithm, [EFFECT] for the MINSQ algorithm and [EFFECT] for uninformed area latency measures. The measurement windows had an effect of [EFFECT] for the CORR algorithm, [EFFECT] for the MINSQ algorithm and [EFFECT] for uninformed area latency measures [See TABLE].

When the correlation with manually extracted latencies was used as a dependent variable, the effect of filter settings for the CORR algorithm were [EFFECT], for the MINSQ algorithm [EFFECT] and [EFFECT] for uninformed area latency measures. The measurement windows had an effect of [EFFECT] for the CORR algorithm, [EFFECT] for the MINSQ algorithm and [EFFECT] for uninformed area latency measures [See TABLE].
