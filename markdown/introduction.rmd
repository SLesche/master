**something about the relevance of ERPs for cognitive sciences**

**examples about the problems of amplitude and latency detection**
**both from a methods-standpoint and a practical standpoint**

**give broad overview of how we intend to solve this: template matching**
**give overview of how this technique is used in other fields of signal processing**

**describe the two general problems: transformation and deviation measure**
**describe the algorithms used to solve these problems and why we implemented them, broadly (more comes in methods section)**

**describe the hopes we have: make it easier, more reliable, more objective than current algorithms**
**explain how we will test this: psychometric properties and correlation with human-picked erps**
**describe which components we will aim to pick and why**
